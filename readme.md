**TL;DR**

- For textless music retrieval scenario (smart speaker), we introduce a framework that recommends music based on the emotions of speech. 
- We explore different speech representations and report their impact on different speech types including acted speech ([IEMOCAP](https://sail.usc.edu/iemocap/)), lexically-matched speech ([RAVDESS](https://zenodo.org/record/1188976)), and wake-up word speech ([HIKIA](https://zenodo.org/record/7091465))
- We also propose an emotion similarity regularization term in cross-domain retrieval tasks.

### Emotion Similarity Regularization (EmoSim)
We propose emotion similarity regularization (EmoSim), modified version of RankSim (Gong et al), for cross-domain retrieval task. An overview of our approach is shown in Figure. In practice, our goal is to encourage alignment between the similarity of neighbors in emotion space S_y and the similarity of neighbors in feature space S_z. The EmoSim regularization term is formulated as follows:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

# code reference: https://github.com/BorealisAI/ranksim-imbalanced-regression
def batchwise_emotion_regularizer(S_z, S_y):
    """
    S_z: feature similarity between speech and music
    S_y: emotion similarity between speech and music
    """
    unique_batch = torch.unique(S_y, dim=1)
    unique_pred = []
    for pred, target, unique_item in zip(S_z, S_y, unique_batch):
        indices = torch.stack([random.choice((target==i).nonzero()[0]) for i in unique_item])
        unique_pred.append(pred[indices])
    emotion_feature = torch.stack(unique_pred)
    emo_loss = F.mse_loss(emotion_feature, unique_batch)
    return emo_loss
```

### 1. Emotion Recognition Pre-training

For the music encoder, we use the [Music Tagging Transformer-compact_student.ckpt](https://github.com/minzwon/semi-supervised-music-tagging-transformer/tree/master/data) which is the most recent state-of-the-art music tagging model. For the speech audio encoder, we use [Wav2vec~2.0](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/wav2vec2) and take the average pooling on its phoneme-level feature to summarize them into utterance-level.

**Note:** 
- music: dataset/pretrained/music/compact_student.ckpt
- audio: wav2vec download from huggingface

```
cd stm/classification/{music_cls, speech_cls}

# fintune pretrained model
python train.py --dataset_type {Audioset, IEMOCAP, RAVDESS, HIKIA} --modality audio

# evaluation on testset
python test.py --dataset_type {Audioset, IEMOCAP, RAVDESS, HIKIA} --modality audio

# extract embedding
python infer.py --dataset_type {Audioset, IEMOCAP, RAVDESS, HIKIA} --modality audio
```

### 2. Speech to Music Retrieval (Metric Learning)

```
cd mtr/metric_learning

# train triplet network
python train.py --speech_type {IEMOCAP, RAVDESS, HIKIA} --modality audio --framework triplet_soft --emo_lambda 0.5

# eval shallow classifier
python test.py --speech_type {IEMOCAP, RAVDESS, HIKIA} --modality audio --framework triplet_soft --emo_lambda 0.5
```

### Visualization
First, we confirmed that all models successfully discriminate emotion semantics. However, in the case of the triplet model, scary music embeddings are located at between sad and happy speech embedding cluster.  This problem is alleviated in Triplet + EmoSim model. There are relatively few scary music samples closer to angry and frustration clusters. We believe that joint embedding space learned inter-modality neighborhood structure from the continuous emotion similarity.
